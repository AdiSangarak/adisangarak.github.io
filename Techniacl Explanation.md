This HTML and JavaScript code demonstrates a simple web-based PDF annotation tool. It uses the PDF.js library for rendering and displaying PDFs and the pdf-lib library for adding annotations/comments to the PDF. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. HTML Structure:
   - The HTML document is fairly straightforward. It includes a `<canvas>` element for displaying the original PDF (`pdf-canvas`) and another `<canvas>` element for displaying the modified PDF (`modified-pdf-canvas`).
   - There's an `<input>` element (`comment-input`) for entering comments and a `<button>` element (`add-comment-button`) for adding comments.
   - Various script tags load the required libraries: pdf-lib for PDF manipulation, pdf.js for PDF rendering, and the pdf.js worker for background processing.
2. JavaScript Function (`main`):
   - The `main` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point for the application.
   - It begins by defining several variables:
     - `pdfUrl`: The URL or path to the PDF file you want to annotate (replace `'./example.pdf'` with the actual PDF file path).
     - `canvas`: A reference to the original PDF canvas.
     - `context`: A 2D rendering context for the original PDF canvas.
     - `commentInput`: A reference to the comment input element.
     - `addButton`: A reference to the "Add Comment" button.
     - `comments`: An array to store the comments entered by the user.
3. Displaying the Original PDF:
   - The code uses the `fetch` API to load the PDF file specified by `pdfUrl`. Once the PDF data is retrieved, it is rendered on the `pdf-canvas` using the pdf.js library.
   - It fetches the first page of the PDF, calculates the viewport dimensions, resizes the canvas to match those dimensions, and renders the PDF page on the canvas.
4. Adding Comments:
   - When the user clicks the "Add Comment" button (`addButton`), an event listener is triggered.
   - It retrieves the comment text entered by the user from `commentInput` and adds it to the `comments` array.
   - The comment is also displayed on the original PDF canvas at a specific location (100, 100) with red color and a 14px Arial font.
   - Using the pdf-lib library, the code loads the PDF file again, embeds the Helvetica font, gets the first page, and adds the comment text as a text annotation to the PDF at a specific (x, y) coordinate.
   - The modified PDF is then saved, and a Blob is created to represent the modified PDF data. This Blob is used to generate a URL for opening the modified PDF in a new tab.
5. Displaying the Modified PDF:
   - The code uses pdf.js to display the modified PDF on the `modified-pdf-canvas` element, similar to how the original PDF is displayed.
   - It loads the modified PDF data, retrieves the first page, calculates the viewport dimensions, resizes the canvas, and renders the modified PDF page.
6. Resetting the Comment Input:
   - After adding a comment, the comment input (`commentInput`) is reset to an empty value.
7. Calling the `main` Function:
   - The `main` function is invoked at the end of the script to start the application.

In summary, this code creates a basic PDF annotation tool that allows users to add comments to a PDF document. It uses pdf.js for rendering PDFs and pdf-lib for adding comments to the PDF. Users can see both the original and modified PDFs in separate canvases.
